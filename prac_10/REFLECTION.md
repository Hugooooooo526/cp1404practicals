# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was initially quite poor, often underestimating the time required to complete tasks by 30-50%. I found that I was particularly inaccurate with complex tasks involving object-oriented programming concepts, such as the taxi simulator and band classes in practical 9.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the semester progressed, my estimates became more realistic. By the later practicals (8-10), my estimates were typically within 15-20% of actual completion time. This improvement came from better understanding of the requirements and a more realistic assessment of debugging time. I learned to account for testing and documentation phases that I had previously overlooked.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that programming involves much more than just writing code. Tasks such as planning, documentation, testing, and debugging often take more time than the actual coding. I also discovered the value of breaking down larger tasks into smaller components to improve estimation accuracy. This skill will be valuable in professional software development where project timelines and resource allocation depend on accurate estimates.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others revealed blind spots in my coding practices that I wouldn't have noticed myself. Reviewers often highlighted opportunities for better variable naming, more efficient algorithms, and missing edge cases in my error handling. I also gained an appreciation for code readability and documentation, as reviewers frequently commented on these aspects. The feedback helped me develop a more user-centered approach to programming.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code exposed me to different approaches and solutions that I hadn't considered. I discovered alternative ways to structure programs, especially in the OOP practicals. The process also reinforced my own understanding as I had to thoroughly comprehend someone else's code before providing constructive feedback. I found that explaining concepts to others deepened my own knowledge.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 6 Code Review](https://github.com/929919/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

In this review, I provided specific, actionable feedback on the ListView implementation. I highlighted areas for improvement in error handling for edge cases and suggested more descriptive variable names that would increase code maintainability. My comments were constructive rather than critical, and I included code snippets to demonstrate the suggested changes. I also acknowledged the strengths of the implementation, particularly the clean separation of concerns between UI components and business logic.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 8 Code Review](https://github.com/Junbinyap/CP-1404-Practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-2745034894)

### Explanation

This review demonstrated a thorough understanding of object-oriented programming principles. I identified several instances where the inheritance hierarchy could be improved to enhance code reuse. My feedback addressed proper encapsulation of attributes and suggested clearer docstrings for methods. I also noted a subtle bug in the fare calculation that could have led to incorrect results. My review maintained a positive tone throughout while providing substantial technical insights that helped my peer improve their understanding of OOP concepts.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would add more collaborative programming exercises, as software development is often a team effort in industry. I would also include more open-ended projects where students could apply the concepts learned in a domain of their interest. Additionally, I would incorporate more code review sessions earlier in the curriculum to establish good practices from the beginning. Finally, I would add more emphasis on test-driven development, as this has become increasingly important in professional settings.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Throughout this subject, I excelled at implementing clean, well-structured code that followed the design patterns taught in the course. I consistently applied proper naming conventions and code organization, especially in the more complex OOP practicals such as the taxi simulator and band classes. I took pride in writing comprehensive docstrings and comments that made my code accessible to others. I also challenged myself to implement bonus features beyond the basic requirements, which deepened my understanding of Python and programming concepts in general.
